description: "Why did we call ourselves the Krypton Chicken?"
---

__*So why do we call ourselves "Krypton Chicken"?*__ We (the GCI 2016 winners) were
thinking about project ideas yesterday and one of us suggested that we need a
"cool" name. Frosty Chicken was the first one to come, but of course, that is a
stupid name. Our conversation somehow drifted towards our favourite element in
the periodic table.

> Geeks

Elements like "Argon", "Xenon", "Krypton" came up and those sounded fairly
interesting. We decided on Krypton as our name, but as usual, it was taken on
Github already.

Someone suggested Krypton + Chicken as a joke initially, but hey, why not? We
had already been spending a few hours brainstorming group names.

*Insert epic ending here* (as suggested by &#64;IlyaBizyaev).
